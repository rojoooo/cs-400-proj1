Today I'm so excited to open my github account. As a cs student I always dreamed about having my own official programming account in the wonderful platform. 
Github is a ncie coding community that I can both share and gain ideas. My first experience with github, however, is not as good as I expected.

When I first talked about it, it seemed so simple. You know, I just got through it. I knew that I had to tell myself I got my facts , and I got through it. I was like, "Oh, well, I got to put it in the dictionary, and this is the one I'm going to use.

But I was stucked very soon. After 3 months, when I opened Github again ready to search some libraries I collected for my in-class project. I found that I forgot which email address I've used for the account! I have 20 more email addresses, and I usually use them all at the similar frequency. I also forgot the names of the libraries I used. Such a pity! After this time, I got a habit to take a note of the account I created for each email address. Though it brought me many troubles, but at least I can easily find my Github account. :D
